Portfolio Performance with Inclusion of Crypto / Digital Currencies
Key takeways:
1. I see a consitent positive performance of the portfolio by inclusing the digital currencies into a complex portfolio of indices and assets. 
2. Weighting optimizations suggests a small percentage (<5% -10%) inclusion creates great sharpe ration and jensen's alpha.
3. Choosing the crypto's is also a key aspect. We see that choosing a non-correlated group of cryptos is beneficial.
